### (optional) Exploitation

#### Exploit

Exploit is the first branch in the exploitation phase. This branch is comparable to the user's optional exploitation phase. This branch is also not generally definable for the admin. At this point, the question posed by the client is investigated. If the client defines the goal of reading a special AWS service, for example an S3 bucket, this scenario is attempted to be implemented in this branch.


#### Complete Takeover

With a complete takover, the admin takes over the client's entire AWS environment. IAM admins and the root user are completely locked out of the AWS environment. Access to the AWS services is no longer possible from the client's side. This branch can simulate a blackmail attempt, for example. The client loses control of their own AWS environment and is forced to reset access or respond to the blackmailer and their demands. Resetting root access in an AWS environment is a complex process. If only the password has been changed, it may be possible to have a new one sent by email. If the email address of the root access has also been changed, the root access can only be reset via AWS itself if AWS approves this process. This branch can be used to test this scenario and check the client's countermeasures.


#### Disruption

In branch disruption, the goal of the admin is to create a disruption in the AWS system. This disruption can be a partial or full encryption of the AWS system or the explicit deletion of important data. Another goal could be to manipulate the assigned rights. This involves locking out IAM users, withdrawing relevant rights or replacing them with other rights. Depending on how it is carried out, this procedure would display an AccessDenied to the IAM user concerned in their daily tasks.


#### Persistence

This branch is particularly relevant for Red Teaming deployments. It enables unnoticed persistent access to an AWS environment. This access is comparable to a backdoor. The Red Teamer could gain unnoticed access to the AWS system again at a later point in time.
