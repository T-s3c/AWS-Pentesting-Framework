# Recon and Enumeration

The first phase of the Outsider is the Recon and Enumeration phase.

## OSINT

Look for urls that contains 
```
<alias>.signin.aws.amazon.com
```
with an alias related to the organization.

## Marketplace

If a vendor has instances in the marketplace, you can get the owner id (account id) of the AWS account he used.

## Snapshots

- Code Repositories: Github, Gitlab etc.
- Shared-stuff
- API Collections on Postman or Swagger
- Check Applications hosted on AWS environements
  - SSRF  
  - Local Files (/.aws/credentials)
- Search in Developer Plattforms with git-hound

## AWS Services

* Public EBS snapshots (EC2 -> Snapshots -> Public Snapshots)
* RDS public snapshots (RDS -> Snapshots -> All Public Snapshots)
* Public AMIs (EC2 -> AMIs -> Public images)
* Public S3 Buckets
