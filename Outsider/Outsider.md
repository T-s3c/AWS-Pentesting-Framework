# Outsider

In this framework, the Outsider is a perspective that tests the AWS cloud environment from the „outside “. In this, the Outsider does not have an AWS key and AWS secret key, nor does it have an IAM account. This distinguishes the Outsider from the other two perspectives. As a result, this perspective is not able to authenticate to AWS for the time being. This may change during testing. This perspective may have knowledge about the internal structure of the cloud environment. Knowledge about the deployed AWS services or valid AWS users can also be provided to the outsider. Unless valid AWS credentials obtained through analysis of the environment or by the customer are available, the Outsider perspective cannot be exited. If during the analysis of the system in the Outsider perspective, credentials to a web application or similar built into the cloud environment are found, this does not change the perspective. In this case, the Outsider perspective remains. Switching to the next perspective - User or Admin - is only possible with successful authentication with valid AWS credentials to one or more AWS services.
