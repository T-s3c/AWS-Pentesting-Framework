# (optional) Exploitation

If lateral or administrative rights are successfully extended, an ex- ploitation can take place. In real test situations, it is not atypical to have individual targets. In concrete terms, this means that it is generally not possible to clearly define what the goal is during the Exploitation phase. For example, a client could ask whether a specific developer account has access to data from employees in an S3 account. Based on this question, the testing person would focus in the exploitation phase on obtaining data in an S3 bucket with the existing rights.
