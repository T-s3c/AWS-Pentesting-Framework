# AWS-Pentesting-Framework

In this master thesis, a reasonable and up-to-date framework for penetration testing for Amazon Web Services (AWS) environments will be designed and evaluated using existing AWS lab environments. Furthermore, configuration vulnerabilities and frequently encountered vulnerabilities known from practice are combined with already known real-world attacks on AWS cloud systems, analyzed and described. In the further course, this thesis is distinguished from already published scientific works. Afterwards, the theoretical basics are discussed for a better understanding. Here, terms such as penetration testing, Red Team, AWS and AWS components, as well as common checklists/vulnerability frameworks, such as OWASP are explained in more detail. Based on this, common security-related vulnerabilities of AWS cloud environments are elaborated and a framework is designed that can be used as a „checklist“ for penetration testing on AWS environments and represents a struc- tured procedure with the goal of reliably disclosing the most common AWS cloud vulnerabilities. An evaluation of the framework takes place using existing established AWS Cloud Training Labs. The applicability of the developed framework to Microsoft Azure environments as well as the applicability to Red Teaming operations will be tested accordingly. A conclusion and an outlook on future additions complete this master thesis.
