## :books: Description
This Repository represents a reasonable and up-to-date framework for penetration testing and red teaming for Amazon Web Services (AWS) environments 

It is build to be be used as a „checklist“ for penetration testing on AWS environments and represents a structured procedure with the goal of reliably disclosing the most common AWS cloud vulnerabilities.

## :microscope: Academic Thesis

It was initially designed and evaluated in the master thesis you can find on my [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374925317_Development_and_evaluation_of_a_cloud_security_testing_framework_for_penetration_testing_and_red_teaming_of_AWS_cloud_environments?utm_source=twitter&rgutm_meta1=eHNsLWdKa09QTXp3NnRRYVhsQUwxL1dFY2I2WXRiS1llUit5amtKVEZYczM0bDg0R21SQ0Y5TU02RU9QbXhncDJzWDZteFM3NnlTTTRCVjZ1KzByWHF4Smk2MD0%3D). For the evalution of this framework like CloudGoat or Flaws were used.

## :blue_book: Whitepaper 
I wrote a whitepaper on this topic. This can be downloaded <a target="_blank" href="https://t-s3c.de/docs/aws%20framework%20whitepaper.pdf">here</a>. 

## Webinars

There will be publicly available webinars on how to use this framework. If you are interested contact me :)

## :dart: How to get started?

This Framework consists of three perspectives each of them represents an individual cycle which the tester should follow during a penetration test or red team assessment.
