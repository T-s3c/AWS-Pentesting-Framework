# AWS-Pentesting-Framework

This is a reasonable and up-to-date framework for penetration testing for Amazon Web Services (AWS) environments 
This Framework was designed and evaluated in the master thesis [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374925317_Development_and_evaluation_of_a_cloud_security_testing_framework_for_penetration_testing_and_red_teaming_of_AWS_cloud_environments?utm_source=twitter&rgutm_meta1=eHNsLWdKa09QTXp3NnRRYVhsQUwxL1dFY2I2WXRiS1llUit5amtKVEZYczM0bDg0R21SQ0Y5TU02RU9QbXhncDJzWDZteFM3NnlTTTRCVjZ1KzByWHF4Smk2MD0%3D)

It is designed to be be used as a „checklist“ for penetration testing on AWS environments and represents a structured procedure with the goal of reliably disclosing the most common AWS cloud vulnerabilities.
